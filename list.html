Along with the platter of meat, you’ll get some plain baos, daikon, radishes, and a delicious sauce. Act like you’ve been here before and make yourself a duck bao sandwich with these ingredients. The server then takes the remnants of meat and bones back to the kitchen where they whip up some duck fried rice and duck bone soup to bring back out. Sun Wah claims the meal can feed up to three, but we don’t think it’s quite enough for three hungry dudes. At $40 a duck, it’s cheap enough to go overboard and make sure you have enough food.” – The Infatuation

The rustic-chic tavern on the outer edges of Pilsen has fast become a destination for savory pie and beer fans. It's sunny and welcoming—and nearly always packed….Pleasant House has built its reputation on its sky-high savory royal pies. Thick steak-and-ale stew is a classic ($8.50) but the vegetarian mushroom and kale—covered in a creamy white wine and parmesan gravy—is also killer. Don't forget to top the whole thing off with a crown of mashed potatoes and gravy. God save the queen, indeed” – Conde Nast Traveler

But you don’t have to possess that information to know that this place is good. The showstopper is its bread, a country loaf with a chewy crust and airy crumb that begs for a generous schmear of Cellar Door’s house-made butter.Two nights a week, the place stays open for dinner, and it’s one of the best-kept secrets in Chicago dining.” – Chicago Magazine

Loba serves six different pastries daily -- all inspired by the years she spent in fine dining, with flavors that draw on her Mexican heritage.

A traditional bar graces the front, but the glassed-in kitchen is where the magic happens. Named after a pale ale brewed in Malta, this watering hole fittingly flaunts a beer list so long that it’s been called ”a novel. ”Mussels are available night and day and arrive in your choice of an herbed white wine broth or a Belgian-style beer broth. Both preparations include a cone of crisp, house-made French fries. The duck breast Rueben is another solid choice, though you should save room for the lemon thyme pound cake, embellished with brown sugar-whipped mascarpone and a blueberry-tarragon compote.” - MICHELIN guide inspectors

            “Parachute is impressive. Parachute is exceptional. Parachute makes us walk out of a meal thinking it was more enjoyable than most of the meals we’ve had at other restaurants, and we eat at a lot of restaurants. Parachute is nice, but not fancy. Different, but not crazy exotic. Lively, but not a party - you can easily hear the people sitting with you…The food speaks louder than the design, but it more than speaks to us, it sings to us, whether it’s the staple dishes or a few of the items that rotate in and out. The Korean American concoctions aren’t exactly Korean, nor are they American, but it’s the kind of fusion that make us nod our heads in approval. We don’t even like using the term fusion. Fusion gives the notion that you should expect to satisfy specific cravings for Korean and American food within a finite set of fusion rules, and that’s not the case. There are no rules at Parachute, only creativity that you should judge from a clean slate. Like a mid 90′s Mariah, Parachute’s food octave is in a league of its own.” – The Infatuation
